# PowwrBI-Project

## OBJECTIVE :

To create a one-page sales report dashboard that effectively showcases Sales Insights, weâ€™ll need to consider the data sources provided and how best to visualize the information. Feel free to use your imagination to best represent the data you have available.

1.	Sales (folder by year)
2.	Categories (Excel)
3.	Geography (Excel)
4.	Product (CSV / Database)
5.	SalesRep (Excel)
6.	SubCategories (Excel)

## Data Gathering / Requirement:

Create a mechanism to load all the files from the sales folder in a single Sales fact table.

> The mechanism needs to be resilient as:

 - Removing a file from the sales folder does not create an error for missing files.
 
 - Adding a new yearly sales file will automatically be loaded in the fact query upon refresh.
